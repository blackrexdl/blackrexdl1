# Hi 👋, I'm Shubu

### A passionate developer from Barnala


</div>

## 🚀 About Me

I turn late-night ideas into → real working appsiOS Developer | Swift | @ CGC Landran | Full Stack Developer | Python Developer | Mern Stack | C++ | DSA | Student-built🔧 apps helping startups ship faster
I’ve built and shipped 29+ software projects, with 12 deployed live — focusing on real execution over theoretical learning.

My core focus is iOS development using Swift, backed by strong full-stack experience across the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I enjoy building products end-to-end — from backend architecture to clean, responsive interfaces.

Instead of waiting for experience, I’ve been creating it — building live systems, experimenting across stacks, and sharing my work publicly through GitHub and deployed projects.

Currently focused on growing as an iOS Developer, I’m looking for opportunities where I can contribute to real products, solve meaningful problems, and keep compounding my skills through hands-on development.
This will be displayed prominently at the top of your profile.

|---|---|---|
| Personal Portfolio | I developed a Personal Portfolio website using React.js, JavaScript, HTML5, and pure CSS, focusing on clean UI design, interactivity, and responsiveness. The project showcases my skills, projects, and contact information in a professional layout.

Key features and technologies I implemented:
	•	Glassmorphism UI with a glass-like navigation bar and smooth toggle animations
	•	Custom animated cursor with trail and hover effects for interactivity
	•	Responsive design optimized for mobile, tablet, and large screens
	•	Portfolio grid with animated image cards
	•	Resume section with timelines and skill bars
	•	Interactive contact section that opens email and phone apps directly
	•	Modular React component architecture for scalability and maintainability
	•	Performance optimization and accessibility considerations

Animations, hover effects, and cursor interactions make the portfolio dynamic and user-friendly, demonstrating my ability to combine design and frontend logic effectively.

This project not only strengthened my React.js skills but also gave me practical experience in UI/UX design, CSS animations, and responsive web development, which are crucial for building professional, real-world applications. | [Live](https://personal-portfolio-vert-zeta-58.vercel.app) / [GitHub](https://github.com/blackrexdl/Personal-Portfolio?tab=readme-ov-file) |
